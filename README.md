# Tensegrity-Table
Tensegrity or tensional integrity, is a structural principle that applies when a set of elements remain in place and balanced, due to a continuous tensile force. After seeing a lego tensegrity structure, I decided to expand on the idea and make a table with the illusion that it is floating. I first designed the table in SolidWorks to ensure that the supporting arms would align. The table was then built from dimensional walnut and glass. It can hold an estimated maximum weight of 300 lbs.
